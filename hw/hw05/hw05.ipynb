Gradescope will automatically submit the PDF from this file to the Homework 5A Written assignment. **There is no need to manually submit Homework 5A Written answers; however, please check that the PDF was generated and submitted correctly**. If you run into any issues when running this cell, feel free to check this [section](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide/autograder_gradescope/autograder_gradescope.html#why-does-grader.exportrun_teststrue-fail-if-all-previous-tests-passed) in the Data 100 Debugging Guide.\n",

    "which can be generated and downloaded from DataHub by using the `grader.export()`\n",

    "* **Homework 5A Written**: Gradescope will automatically submit the PDF from the zip file submitted earlier. You do not need to submit anything to this assignment yourself, but please check that the submission went through properly.  \n",

    "**Important**: When submitting Homework 5B on Gradescope, you **must tag pages to each question correctly** (it prompts you to do this after submitting your work). This significantly streamlines the grading process for our readers. Failure to do this may result in a score of 0 for untagged questions.\n",

We will not be granting regrade requests nor extensions to submissions that don't follow instructions.** If you encounter any difficulties with submission, please don't hesitate to reach out to staff prior to the deadline."
