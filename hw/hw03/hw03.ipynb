DistilBERT is a neural network-based language model (a close relative to ChatGPT); we will use the model checkpoint specifically trained for sentiment analysis. These models are not in scope for Data 100, and we don't expect you to know how they work; take CS182: Neural Networks or Data 102: Data, Inference, and Decisions if you're interested in learning more. We are using them here to show how easy (and useful) these technologies have become.\n",
