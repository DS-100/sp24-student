    "\n",
    "Which approach is better, `%sql` magic or `pd.read_sql`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL database generally contains much more data than what you would analyze in detail. As a `python`-fluent data scientist, you will often query SQL databases to perform initial exploratory data analysis, a subset of which you load into `python` for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you would likely use a combination of the two approaches. First, you'd try out some SQL queries with `%sql` magic to get an interesting subset of data. Then, you'd copy over the query into a `pd.read_sql` command for visualization, modeling, and export with `pandas`, sklearn, and other `python` libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SQL assignments in this course, to minimize unruly error messages while maximizing `python` compatibility, we suggest the following \"sandboxed\" workflow:\n",
    "1. Create a `%%sql` magic cell using the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    %% sql\n",
    "    -- This is a comment. Put your code here... --\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Work on the SQL query in the `%%sql` cell; e.g., `SELECT ... ;`\n",
    "3. Then, once you're satisfied with your SQL query, copy it into the multi-string query in the answer cell (the one that contains the `pd.read_sql` call).\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to follow the above workflow to get full credit on assignments, but we suggest it to reduce debugging headaches. We've created the scratchwork `%%sql` cells for you in this assignment—but **if you add any cells, please delete them before submitting**. Newly added cells will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file. -->\n"
